# PriDE 3 User Manual Sources
Markdown sources for the user manual and generator scripts to produce various output formats.

The HTML results are supposed to be published on the PriDE website [https://j-pride.github.io/](https://j-pride.github.io/). So generating HTML and checking the layout requires to copy the stylesheet folders from the website first. You need the folders [assets](https://github.com/j-pride/j-pride.github.io/tree/master/assets) and [images](https://github.com/j-pride/j-pride.github.io/tree/master/images) which you can find in the [PriDE website GitHub project](https://github.com/j-pride/j-pride.github.io).

When you make changes to the style sheets, you should copy over some of the none-generated HTML pages from the PriDE website to check if the styles are still suitable for the hand-written parts.
